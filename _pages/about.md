Hello, thanks for stopping by! My name is Naiti [IPA: neÎ¸i], originating inthe   currently a fourth year at Scripps College, majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience. I'm broadly excited about uncovering cognitive processes using methods of machine learning; more specifically, I'm currently interested in perceptual learning and pattern recognition.

I'm currently a CSLI summer research intern, working on a project exploring object categorization in infant visual scenes with Bria Long and Mike Frank in the Language and Cognition Lab. Over the summer of 2019, I did research with Katie Tregillus and Steve Engel at the University of Minnesota, working on pattern recognition with fMRI signals of activation for a color vision project.
