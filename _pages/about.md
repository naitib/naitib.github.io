I am a senior at Scripps College, majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience. My current interests include visual learning and perception, pattern and object recognition, and methods of functional neuroimaging. I'm currently an REU student through Stanford CSLI, working on a project exploring object categorization of infant egocentric views with Bria Long and Mike Frank in the Language and Cognition Lab. Over the summer of 2019, I worked with Katherine Tregillus and Steve Engel on a project exploring the cortical correlates associated with the long lasting adaptation of the McCollough effect.
