Hello, thanks for stopping by! My name is Naiti [IPA: neÎ¸i]. I am currently a fourth year student at Scripps College, majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience, where I am advised by Tessa Solomon-Lane and Julie Medero. I'm working on my senior thesis, exploring object categorization in infant visual scenes, which is supervised by Bria Long, Michael C. Frank, and John G. Milton.

I am broadly excited about the intersection of cognitive development and artificial learning, specifically with respect to perceptual learning and pattern recognition.

I completed two NSF-funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates: over the summer of 2019 at the University of Minnesota, I did research with Katie Tregillus and Steve Engel in the Engel Vision and Imaging Lab, and over the summer of 2020 at Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information, I remotely worked with Bria Long and Mike Frank in the Language and Cognition Lab.

I grew up in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, USA.
