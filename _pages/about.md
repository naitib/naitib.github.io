Hello, thanks for stopping by! I'm Naiti [IPA: neÎ¸i] currently senior at Scripps College, majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience. I'm broadly excited about uncovering cognitive processes using methods of machine learning; more specifically, I'm currently interested in perceptual learning and pattern recognition.

I'm currently an REU student through Stanford CSLI, working on a project exploring object categorization of infant egocentric views with Bria Long and Mike Frank in the Language and Cognition Lab. Over the summer of 2019, I worked with Katherine Tregillus and Steve Engel at the University of Minnesota, working on pattern recognition with fMRI signals of activation for a color vision project.
