Hello, thanks for stopping by! My name is Naiti [IPA: neÎ¸i]. I am currently a fourth year at Scripps College, majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience and am broadly excited about uncovering cognitive processes using methods of machine learning; more specifically, I'm currently interested in perceptual learning and pattern recognition.

I'm currently working on my thesis, exploring object categorization in infant visual scenes, continuing my summer work through Stanford University's CSLI internship, with Bria Long and Mike Frank in the Language and Cognition Lab. Over the summer of 2019, I did research with Katie Tregillus and Steve Engel at the University of Minnesota, working on pattern recognition with fMRI signals of activation for a color vision project. 

I'm currently looking to enter a lab manager or research assistant position in the realm of experimental psychology as I prepare to apply to graduate programs in the field.
